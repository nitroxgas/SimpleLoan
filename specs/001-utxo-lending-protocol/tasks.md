## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational completion
  - US1 (Supply): Can start after Foundational
  - US2 (Borrow): Can start after Foundational (integrates with US1 but independently testable)
  - US3 (Liquidate): Can start after Foundational (requires US1+US2 concepts but independently testable)
  - US4 (Withdraw): Can start after Foundational (completes US1 lifecycle)
  - US5 (Interest Rates): Can start after Foundational (enhances all stories)
- **Validators (Phase 8)**: Can proceed in parallel with user stories
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (P1)**: Independent - can complete alone for MVP
- **US2 (P2)**: Independent - uses oracle and debt models
- **US3 (P3)**: Independent - uses liquidation logic
- **US4 (P4)**: Extends US1 - completes supply lifecycle
- **US5 (P5)**: Enhances all - dynamic rates

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Once Foundational completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Validators and Coq proofs can be developed in parallel with backend/frontend

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T009)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T010-T024) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T025-T037)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test supply → accrue → withdraw flow
5. Deploy to regtest and demo

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add US1 → Test independently → Deploy (MVP!)
3. Add US2 → Test independently → Deploy
4. Add US3 → Test independently → Deploy
5. Add US4 → Test independently → Deploy
6. Add US5 → Test independently → Deploy
7. Add Validators → Formal verification complete
8. Polish → Production ready

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 3 developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T024)
2. Once Foundational done:
   - Developer A: US1 Supply (T025-T037)
   - Developer B: US2 Borrow (T038-T050)
   - Developer C: Validators (T070-T080)
3. Stories integrate and test independently

## Notes

- [P] = Parallelizable (different files, no blocking dependencies)
- [US#] = User story label for traceability
- Each user story independently completable and testable
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Follow constitution: formal verification, testnet-first, modular design
